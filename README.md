# The Titanic

This is a famous problem for beginners of data science to solve.
The problem is as such:

Given is a set of details of people onboard the Titanic with systemic information
present divided into 2 files, namely 'train.csv' and 'test.csv'.

The hyperparameter, which is provided in 'train.csv' and absent in 'test.csv' is whether the
passengers survived, or they perished, denoted by 0 and 1 respectively.

Given the data, attempt to predict the data, ascertaining the survivability of passengers, listed in 'test.csv'.
